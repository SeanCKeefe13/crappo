# Crappo

[See demo](https://seanckeefe13.github.io/crappo)

The players take turn rolling the 6 dice, each time a scoring value is rolled the dice become "locked".
E
ach player must score 1,000 points before they are able to save any roll with a total roll score lower than 1,000 and keep that saved total.
    -EX 
        Player One, Total Points = 0, 1st turn: Roll Score = 750 and scores no more points they may not enter the round because they did not score 1,000 to enter. 
        Player One, Total Points 1000, 5th turn: Roll Score = 750 and Player One saves the points and end their turn. Because they have already scored 1,000 points they can now keep lower scoring rolls.

Once a players total score reaches 10,000 they can steal the previous players remaining dice and current roll score.
    -EX player one: roll score 500, with 3 dice remaining. Player Two: steals 500 points, rolls remaining 3 dice and scores 100 points.
    Player Two can now save their score (500 from Player One score + 100 from Player Two roll) and end their turn.

Once the first Player reaches 20,000 points the game ends.
